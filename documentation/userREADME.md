## User Documentation: Auto Watering Pot

The goal of this pot is to make your plant care life easier. It takes in data from 
its numerous sensors and uses the data to rectify problems, notify you of any that can't be
fixed on their own & hopefully in the near future, make suggestions based on the plant inside it. 

### Getting Started

To get started, fill the resevoir with water and plant something in the pot. **Be careful of the internal soil moisture sensors when potting.** 

Plug in the device. Wait for it to connect and it should be accessible in the Losant 
dashboard.
